## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Open any file
Each file is self-contained with a `main()` method.

### 2. Uncomment the question
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Uncomment to practice
    // question1();
    // question2();
    question3();  // ← Uncomment the one you want to practice
}
```

### 3. Run and test
```bash
javac Level1_Basics.java
java Level1_Basics
```

## 📖 What Each Question Includes

Every question comes with:

- ✅ **Logic Explanation** - Understanding the approach
- ✅ **Step-by-step Algorithm** - How it works
- ✅ **Multiple Solutions** - Different approaches when applicable
- ✅ **Visualizations** - ASCII diagrams for complex logic
- ✅ **Complexity Analysis** - Time and space considerations
- ✅ **Interview Tips** - Common variations and edge cases

### Example:
```java
// =========================================================================
// QUESTION 4: Check if number is palindrome
// =========================================================================
/*
 * LOGIC EXPLANATION:
 * A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.
 * Reverse the number and compare with original.
 * 
 * Example: 121
 * Reverse: 121
 * 121 == 121 → Palindrome ✓
 */
public static void question4() {
    // Implementation here...
}
```
